## Fun Project to learn Julia. Checkout the res folder for the generated images.
### It is a 1-D QCA and the rows represnt the generations.\
### The boxes represent the complex coefficients\
### The complex coefficients have been mapped to RGB color via a simple formula\
### The complex number has an angle and radius, the angle reprenet the color on the color wheel and the r,g,b channels value grow with decreasing radius\
### Here the complex coefficients are generated by acting a unitary operator(on neighbouring qubits like [1,2] or [3,4] etc) tensor identity on remaining qubits. \
### for unitary acting on 1st and last qubit, a similarity transformation by a permuation matrix was used. The perm matrix permutes the last and 2nd qubit and the unitary of 1st and 2nd qubit was used,
